            <h1>Migrants and Refugees</h1>
            <p>
                The distribution of people all over the world is highly dynamic. People travel for a
                variety of reasons and often migrate permanently to new countries. This can happen
                because of work or for personal reasons but sometimes is not a choice at all.
                Sometimes is the only way to avoid persecution based on race, religion or political
                opinion.
            </p>
            <p>
                When that is the case the individuals forced to leave their country are called
                "refugees". The 1951 Refugee Convention,ratified​ by 145 State parties, is the key
                legal document on the matter. It defines the term ‘refugee’ and outlines the rights
                of the displaced, as well as the legal obligations of States to protect them. The
                core principle is non-refoulement, which asserts that a refugee should not be
                returned to a country where they face serious threats to their life or freedom. This
                is now considered a rule of customary international law.
            </p>
            <p>
                The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) serves as the ‘guardian’
                of the 1951 Convention and its 1967 Protocol. The UNHCR makes all his data
                concerning refugees publicy available but extracting insights from massive
                spreadsheets is not always easy. Here we present a visual perspective on the dynamic
                of the flow of asylum seekers over time.

                    A refugee is someone who is unable or unwilling to return to their country of
                    origin owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race,
                    religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group, or political
                    opinion.

            <cite>– 1951 UNHCR convention relating to the status of refugees</cite>

            <p>
                People don't have to "apply" to become a refugee. As soon as the conditions outlined
                in the 1951 convention are met individuals are automatically considered refugees.
                However, to have their status legally recognized by governments they have to undergo
                a Refugee Status Determination (RSD) process.
            </p>
            <p>
                This process starts by asking a foreign country for asylum. Every month thousands of
                refugees are forced to cross borders and the Convention stipulates that refugees
                should not be penalized for their illegal entry or stay. This recognizes that the
                seeking of asylum can require refugees to breach immigration rules. Prohibited
                penalties might include being charged with immigration or criminal offences relating
                to the seeking of asylum, or being arbitrarily detained purely on the basis of
                seeking asylum.
            </p>
            <p>
                Monthly data regarding the amount of asylum seekers applying for entry in a specifc
                country is made available by the UNHCR along with informations about their origin
                (when possible). As we can see in the map above this naturally leads to the creation
                of an intricate network. For the sake of visualization the map reports the movement
                of groups of at least 100 individuals.

                From a network point of view the movement of asylum seekers form a temporal directed
                geometric graph. It is temporal because even if the main edges (in terms of asylum
                seekers travelling across them) persist across time many smaller ones appear and
                disappear as a function of time. Is is also
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_graph_theory">geometric</a>
                in nature since the node (i.e. countries) are embedded in a phisical space, a 3D one
                to be precise but here for the sake of simplicity were are going to consider their
                projection on a 2D plane using the
                <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Transverse_Mercator_coordinate_system"
                    >UTM</a
                >
                and therefore form an Euclidean graph.
            </p>
            <p>
                The fact that nodes are spatially located provides a useful extra piece of
                information. While in non-geometric graphs we usually characterize a node by the
                in/out-degree distribution, now we have an extra piece of information to work with,
                the angle between edges. As we can see in the visualization above this means that
                every point has a distinctive "fingerprint" given by the shape of unit vectors
                pointing to other nodes. If we consider the unit vector distribution for a specific
                node as a sort of "view" from that node it could happen that if the nodes' spatial
                distribution has a symmetric structure we would have "view" from different place but
                that is not an issue in this context, countries are fairly irregular. It is now
                natural to ask oneself, can we leverage this spatial information to visualize the
                movement of asylum seekers over time?

            <p>
                Since nodes have coordinates associated to them we can treat edges as if they were
                vectors. These vectors have a magnitude given by the euclidean distance bewteen two
                node but in our case we are more interested in the flow of refugees between two
                countries, rather than measuring how far apart Russia and Canada are. Therefore we
                are going to use the amount of asylum seeker moving along an edge at a specific
                point in time as a measure of that vector magnitude. This way we can aggregate the
                total flow simply using vector summation.
            </p>
            <img src="EdgesToCompass.svg" alt="Combining refugee flows" class="center" />
            <p>
                This approach allows us to build some sort of "compass" of the refugee flow. At
                every point in time the compass will point in the direction of the resulting total
                flow. This has some limitations, mainly due to the fact that we are considering a 2D
                projection of 3D entities, which is a major problem in cartography. However this
                still captures some interesting information, for example the fact that the compass'
                needle stably points toward Norh-West.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the above visualization we can see the resulting "compass". On top we can see the
                overall count of refugess, color coded from green to red, with green being the
                lowest amount observed during the years considered and red the highest. In the
                bottom left we can see the individual vectors before being summed and finally in the
                bottom right we can see the the compass.
